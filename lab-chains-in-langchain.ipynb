My only criticism would be that I wish seller would offer the king size set with 4 pillowcases. I separately ordered a two pack of pillowcases so I could have a total of four. When I saw the two packages, it looked like the color did not exactly match. Customer service was excellent about sending me two more pillowcases so I would have four that matched. Excellent! For the cost of these sheets, I am satisfied with the characteristics and coolness of the sheets.\"\\nWaterproof Phone Pouch,\"I loved the waterproof sac, although the opening was made of a hard plastic.

Maybe I got unlucky with a defective mattress, but where\\'s quality assurance for this company? That flat out should not happen. Emphasis on flat. Cause that\\'s what the mattress was. Seriously horrible experience, ruined my friend\\'s stay with me. Then they make you ship it back instead of just providing a refund, which is also super annoying to pack up an air mattress and take it to the UPS store. This company is the worst, and this mattress is the worst.\"\\nPillows Insert,\"This is the best throw pillow fillers on Amazon. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried several others, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all cheap and flat no matter how much fluffing you do.

But they only seem to last a few months. The company was great replacing the first one (the frother falls out of the handle and can\\'t be fixed). The after 4 months my second one did the same.
